Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: this would be much usefull if I'm working on multible devices and platforms, and for sharing the work with others.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: this wouold be very dangoures, i may pull some changes that others did while i don't want them now, as they may affect the testing i do for the work in may hand.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Forks are for copying the repositories of someone else that im not a contributer in it and start using the code (or the files) to make my own.
Clone is to copying any repositories i made to other places.
Branch is to make new way in the repositories I'm working in to test new things.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: it allow us to compre the changes we did localy with the one we expect to be on the remote, without being online.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: for coding projects, i will have to send the code i made each time i change something to my collaborators through e-mails or maybe use share documentation on google docs or dropbox, for sure now i see that Git is much easier than other obtions (that fetch command is really usefull)
